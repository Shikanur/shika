                <aside>And I didn't want anything special. <br>
                    but since last year I have been dying just <br>
                    thinking about how beautiful our planet is and I <br>
                    can’t wait to see all the beautiful places on it. <br>
                    and here comes the reason why I want to change <br>
                    my profession, starting to do something <br>
                    completely foreign to me, but which brings me <br>
                    so much pleasure and also gives me the <br>
                    opportunity to travel in the future and at the <br>
                    same time work remotely. <br>
                    Below you can see an incomplete list of things <br>
                    I’ve been trying to do and then places I visited, <br>
                    am crazy about and want to visit no matter the <br>
                    cost.

                    killed all my desire for life. but now I understand that we <br>
                    live once and we must live in such a way that there are no regrets later. one must live, not just
                    exist. and after I understood this, <br>
                    I realized that I wanted to live; my soul became so calm. I really like the way I think now, how I
